# Contribution Guide
Thank you for being here. Contributions are welcomed !

## How to contribute to the project:
First of all if you want to fix a bug, add a new feature you need to create an issue. Explain explicitly and clearly in the title what you want to do.

Describe more in details in the description of the issue. Add label(s) and assign it to you.

### Make a fork of the project Github directory

### Install the project locally
You need to follow the [README](https://github.com/eddesscv/P8-OC-ToDoList/blob/master/README.md) to install the project... and come back.

### Start working
Before writing your code to the project follow this : 

>   Git Pull to get full code

> Create a branch (with clear name of the feature you will add like : feature-tasks, feature-bug-auth, etc):

    git checkout -b new-branch

>   Write your code

>   Add test(s) of your new feature in /tests (the results will be shown in /build)


>   Commit with small description of what you have done
   
> Push the branch on your fork :
    
    git push origin new-branch
    
Open a pull request on the Github directory of project

### After finishing to develop the feature, or fix the bug
> **Create a Pull Request** on the dev branch. Assign yourself, add the owner / admin in review, add a label, describe what you have done and don't forget to link the Pull Request to the issue you created.
We take care of the rest.

### Thanks for contributing
